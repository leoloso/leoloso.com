Howdy! My name is **Leonardo Losoviz**, I'm an [award winning](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/performance-challenge-winners-results/) freelance developer and consultant, creator of the open source **[PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP)** project (for building applications based on server-side components: [APIs](https://github.com/getpop/api) and, coming soon, [dynamic](https://github.com/getpop/site) and [static](https://github.com/getpop/static-site-generator) sites), regular contributor to **[Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/leonardolosoviz/)**, and ocassional conference speaker. _I code, I learn, I share._

**I am available for hiring!**<br/>I specialize in **building APIs** (I designed a schemaless [GraphQL API](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql)), **creating sites that run with any CMS or PHP framework** (WordPress, Laravel, Symfony) and can be **deployed on serverless PHP** (I designed [a library](https://github.com/getpop/component-model) which is the optimal mechanism to deploy atomic functionality), and **optimizing content management across platforms** (I designed [a WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-metadata/) to tackle this problem).
