Howdy! My name is **Leonardo Losoviz**, I'm an [award winning](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/performance-challenge-winners-results/) freelance developer and consultant, creator of the open source [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP) project (for building applications based on server-side components), regular contributor to [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/leonardolosoviz/), and ocassional conference speaker. 

_I code, I learn, I share._

**I am available for hiring!** I specialize in building APIs (I authored [an improved version of GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql) on PHP, which is faster and offers more capabilities than the standard GraphQL), creating sites that run with any CMS or PHP framework and can be deployed on serverless PHP (I authored a [component model](https://github.com/getpop/component-model) which is the optimal mechanism to deploy atomic functionality, and which can work with WordPress, Laravel, Symfony and others), and optimizing content management across platforms (I authored [a WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-metadata/) to tackle this problem).
