**I am available for hiring:** I specialize in **building APIs** (my implementation of a schemaless [GraphQL API](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql) is incredibly powerful), and **creating sites** that can **run with any CMS or PHP framework** (WordPress, Laravel, Symfony) and can be **deployed on serverless PHP** (my [Component Model](https://github.com/getpop/component-model) library provides an optimal mechanism to develop standalone, compact functionality to be deployed on serverless instances).

_Happy reading!_
