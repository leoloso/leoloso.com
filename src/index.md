Howdy! My name is **Leonardo Losoviz**, I am the creator and maintainer of:

üëâ [GraphQL API for WordPress](https://graphql-api.com): a GraphQL server for WordPress<br/>
üëâ [GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com/): a CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP<br/>
üëâ [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP): an architecture of server-side components in PHP

I am also a writer, contributing regularly to several online magazines, including [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/leonardolosoviz/), [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/leonardolosoviz/), the [LogRocket blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/leonardolosoviz/), [MasterWP](https://masterwp.com/author/leonardo-losoviz/), the [Kinsta blog](https://kinsta.com/blog/author/leonardolosoviz/), the [StepZen blog](https://stepzen.com/blog/), [Design Bombs](https://www.designbombs.com/author/leo/) and [WPKube](https://www.wpkube.com/author/leo/). And I am an occasional conference speaker.

**I am available for hiring!** I specialize in building APIs (I authored [an improved version of GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql) on PHP, which is faster and offers more capabilities than the standard GraphQL), creating sites that run with any CMS or PHP framework and can be deployed on serverless PHP (I authored a [component model](https://github.com/getpop/component-model) which is the optimal mechanism to deploy atomic functionality, and which can work with WordPress, Laravel, Symfony and others), and optimizing content management across platforms (I authored [a WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-metadata/) to tackle this problem). -->
