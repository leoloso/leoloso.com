## Frameworks/Specifications

[PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP) describes an architecture based on a server-side component model, which provides a mechanism to build, configure and even deploy the application. Currently implemented in PHP, it is intended to become a specification so that it can be implemented in any language.

## Libraries

[GraphQL API](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql) is an implementation of GraphQL, using components. It is based on PoP's component-based architecture, making the application become a GraphQL server.

[Field Query](https://github.com/getpop/field-query) is a syntax to query GraphQL through URL params, which grants a GraphQL API the capability to be cached on the server.

## WordPress plugins

[Block Metadata](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-metadata/) enables to extract all the metadata for all the Gutenberg blocks inside of a blog post, converting this metadata into a medium-agnostic format. Its goal is to implement the "Create Once, Publish Everywhere" strategy (alias COPE), enabling to have our blog posts become the single source of truth for all content, for all different mediums or platforms: web, email/newsletters, iOS/Android apps, home assistants (like Amazon Alexa), car-entertainment systems, and so on.

## Websites

I have created the following websites for different NGOs. All of them are social networks, enabling users to upload their own content, and leveraging the capabilities from [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP).

[MESYM](https://www.mesym.com) - An environmental social network based in Malaysia.

## Ventures

I am on my way to become an entrepreneur, through the following ventures (which I'm still working on):

[Verticals](https://verticals.io) - a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution to provide decentralized vertical portals, composed by niche websites (which are autonomous, living under their own URL), to anyone. It's a B2B, providing the infrastructure, software and tools for entrepreneurs to launch their own businesses, to own and monetize their own vertical portals.

[SukiPoP](https://sukipop.com) - An implementation of a social network from Verticals. This website demonstrates how a community can own its own social network.
