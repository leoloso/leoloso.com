Well, that took time! After several months, I finally launched the site for my plugin GraphQL API for WordPress:

[https://graphql-api.com](https://graphql-api.com)

It took so long, because when you're doing everything on your own (which is my case, I don't have a team), you literally need to do everything. So to make this website, I had to learn so many things:

- Jamstack + Eleventy
- CSS animations
- Screencasting

And I even had to design the logo (with help from my wife):

![GraphQL API for WordPress logo](/images/graphql-api-logo-with-name.jpg "GraphQL API for WordPress logo")

It looks not bad, right? üòÖ

And all of that while still [developing the plugin](https://graphql-api.com/blog/released-graphql-api-v07-with-mutations-and-nested-mutations/), and [writing documentation](https://graphql-api.com/guides), so that users can start playing with it immediately.

But it's been worth it. I'm very pleased with how it looks. Check this image for instance, added to the homepage:

![Click click click click Publish](/images/click-publish.png "Click click click click Publish")

I believe it's able to convey how powerful the product is, which was my goal all along.

Now, on to the next challenge: how to get people to visit it üôÄ
