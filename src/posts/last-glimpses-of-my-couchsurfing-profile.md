Because [Couchsurfing is dead](https://leoloso.com/posts/couchsurfing-is-dead/), I requested to get all my data from the site, before having my account deleted. 

I just got the data: the images are resized down (they don't have the original dimensions I uploaded them with), and the data is a dull `.json` file, which does not reflect any of the personality, feelings or enjoyment that this same piece of data had in the site.

It sucks.

But at least, because the CS reps didn't know how to satisfy my requirements for my own data, they gave me temporary access to the site. So I could log in a final time, and took a few screenshots of my profile in the site.

These are the last glimpses of my CouchSurfing activity, after being a member for 14 years!
