I started using Gutenberg several months ago, so I'm in that stage of being an experienced newbie. Coming from a PHP background, not much JS, some things were easier to understand and pull off, some others more difficult.

I have the impression than most WordPress developers are in the same situation. So I've been compiling my aha moments, and wrote a couple of articles for the [LogRocket blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/) with my tips. 

I just had the first article published:

👉🏻 [Setting up your first Gutenberg project](https://blog.logrocket.com/setting-up-first-gutenberg-project/)

The second part will come next week.

I hope you enjoy it!
