Anyone wanting to start a career as a writer for an online magazine (such as [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com), which is where I submit all of my articles) will possibly find it difficult to even replying the most basic, and important, question: What to write about? Indeed, coming up with a response to this question has proved unsurmountable in several cases I know of, discouraging the person from writing the piece. 

Below, I will share how I manage to reply that question for myself, for each article I've written so far, and all the ones I hope to write in the future.

In first instance, there are no topics out of bounds. Do you want to talk about the latest trends in Artificial Intelligence? Go for it! Have you installed a new Content Management System and want to describe how smooth the experience was? Sure, why not! Have you prolonged your users' browsing time on your site and want to share how you achieved it? Absolutely! Do you want to explain how you created that still-life using only HTML and CSS? Please do it!

As a starter to decide the topic of your article, you can simply find out what you are good at and focus on that. You may think that you are not entitled to write since you're not the best concerning your area of work. And you know what? You are right. But only in part: Yes, you are not the best, since there is always somebody out there with more knowledge than any of us about any topic (allegedly not even Charlie Chaplin could win a competition on imitating Chaplin). But that doesn't mean you can't write about your topic! You don't need to be the best... You only need to be good enough, and to have the conviction to do it. And if you don't feel confident enough, remember that even [the experts sometimes do not feel confident enough](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/confessions-impostor-syndrome/)! 

If you still don't know exactly what you want to write about, don't despair. Just start with an idea. Write your initial idea down on a simple .txt file (or wherever it is most convenient to you), and let it grow over the days, adding new ideas as they come to your head, upgrading previous ones, and removing those ones that make no sense anymore. After some time, as the ideas accumulate and take a certain shape, you will know that the foundation for your article will be established. The rest is simply to write the piece: arranging the sections into a proper order, adding content, and giving it coherence.
