I have just released version 0.6 of the [GraphQL API for WordPress](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/tree/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql) 🎉. 

This is a mighty new version, with [several new features and improvements](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/tree/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/docs/en/release-notes/0.6.md):

✅ The **GraphiQL Explorer** has been **added to all the GraphiQL clients**, including the public ones</br>
✅ Added support for **GitHub Updater**, to enable self-updating when there's a new version</br>
✅ The plugin is **coded with PHP 7.4**, and can **run with PHP 7.1**</br>
✅ Introduced "**embeddable fields**", a custom GraphQL query syntax construct to enable templating and improve performance</br>
✅ **PHPStan** has been upgraded to **level 8** (the strictest level), reducing the change of bugs happening</br>
✅ Release notes are displayed within the plugin, after being updated</br>

👉🏽 Read the descriptions in detail [in the release notes](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL/tree/master/layers/GatoGraphQLForWP/plugins/gatographql/docs/en/release-notes/0.6.md).
