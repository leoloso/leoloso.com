Because [Couchsurfing is dead](https://leoloso.com/posts/couchsurfing-is-dead/) (or, more appropriately, Couchsurfing has been killed), I requested to delete my account from the site. And it's been done: [my profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/leoloso) does not exist anymore.

But, surprise surprise, they have not deleted my photos! For instance, this is photo of mine is still hosted on their cloud, under [https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.couchsurfing.us/BSCVRF/12025899_l_9af860f8f864e0d0c05e99f112125245.jpg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.couchsurfing.us/BSCVRF/12025899_l_9af860f8f864e0d0c05e99f112125245.jpg):

![A non-deleted photo of mine](/images/cs-not-deleted-photo.png "A non-deleted photo of mine")

These guys should have deleted all my data, absolutely all of it, including photos. To be sure that that would happen, I explicitly mentioned this when requesting to close down my account:

![Requesting to delete my data](/images/cs-request-delete-data.png "Requesting to delete my data")

They deleted my account, and replied back, saying that they were closing the ticket (thank you guys for giving me the chance to acknowledge that it was done properly!). As I noticed that my photos were still there, I replied to that same email, asking them, once again, to delete them:

![Requesting to delete my data, again](/images/cs-request-delete-data-again.png "Requesting to delete my data, again")

To which I got a response, saying that my ticket would be handled within 3 days:

![New ticket for old request](/images/cs-ticket-last-response.png "New ticket for old request")

It's been one week now, and still no news from them. Needless to say, my photos are still there.

Btw, if they supposedly deleted my email from their Zendesk ticket system, how does it know that my name is Leonardo?

## What will happen next

I know what will happen. The Couchsurfing guys will somehow find out about this blog post, and in order to avoid blame, they will say it was a mistake, we are very sorry, but look, we have deleted the images now.

## Invoking GDPR, anyone?

I wouldn't be surprised that this is not an isolated case. I bet that they are only deleting my data from their website database, but not all other assets, such as my photos. And this, through the GDPR legislation, **is illegal**.

I'm not European, so I can't do anything about it. But if you're European, and you have requested to delete your CS account and all its data, you can try to **find out if they have deleted your images!**.

If they still hold your photos (which is your data, not theirs), they could be punished through GDPR.
