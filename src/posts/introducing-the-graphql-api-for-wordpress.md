Yesterday I launched the project I've put all my efforts into: the [GraphQL API for WordPress](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api), a plugin which enables to retrieve data from a WordPress site using the increasingly popular [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API.

![Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPress](/images/interactive-schema.png "Interactive Schema screen in GraphQL API for WordPres")

I've been developing this plugin full time for most of the last 12 months. And, taken together with [GraphQL by PoP](https://graphql-by-pop.com) (the CMS-agnostic GraphQL server in PHP, on which it is based), I've spent several years into this project.

So it's a great relief and pleasure to be finally able to release it to the world. In this blog post I explain all about it.

## Existing API solutions in WordPress

Before anything, let's tackle the elephant in the room. You may be thinking: "Wait a second. Aren't there already API solutions for WordPress?"

Yes, there are. The 2 most popular solutions are WP REST API, which is already part of WordPress core, and [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/), a plugin which is also based in GraphQL.

    </div>
</div>

"I thought so! But aren't these APIs already good?"

Yes, they are indeed good. The WP REST API is kept always up-to-date with the latest requirements from the WordPress project, most notably concerning Gutenberg. And WPGraphQL, even though it hasn't been published to the WordPress directory yet, has become more stable during the past year, gained an increasing community of users, and is approaching its 1.0 version.

"So then, why do we need yet another solution?"

Possibly, you do not need another solution. If whichever solution you're already using satisfies all your needs, and doesn't give you any trouble at all, then stay there.

But if your solution doesn't fully satisfy your needs, because it's not so fast, secure or friendly to use; it takes plenty of time to code or write documentation for it; it has limitations that hinder your application; or any other reason at all... then hear me out.

## What's so good about this new plugin

These are, I believe, GraphQL API for WordPress's two killer features:

### 1. Persisted queries

Persisted queries use GraphQL to provide pre-defined enpoints as in REST, obtaining the benefits of both APIs.

With **REST**, you create multiple endpoints, each returning a pre-defined set of data.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| ‚úÖ It's simple | ‚ùå It's tedious to create all the endpoints |
| ‚úÖ Accessed via `GET` or `POST` | ‚ùå A project may face bottlenecks waiting for endpoints to be ready |
| ‚úÖ Can be cached on the server or CDN | ‚ùå Producing documentation is mandatory |
| ‚úÖ It's secure: only intended data is exposed | ‚ùå It can be slow (mainly for mobile apps), since the application may need several requests to retrieve all the data |

With **GraphQL**, you provide any query to a single endpoint, which returns exactly the requested data.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| ‚úÖ It can be fast, since all data is retrieved in a single request | ‚ùå Accessed only via `POST` |
| ‚úÖ It enables rapid iteration of the project | ‚ùå It can't be cached on the server or CDN, making it slower and more expensive than it could be |
| ‚úÖ It can be self-documented | ‚ùå It may require to reinvent the wheel (eg: uploading files) |
| ‚úÖ It provides an editor for the query (GraphiQL) that simplifies the task | ‚ùå Must deal with additional complexities, such as the N+1 problem |

**Persisted queries** combine these 2 approaches together:

- It uses GraphQL to create and resolve queries
- But instead of exposing a single endpoint, it exposes every pre-defined each under its own endpoint
- Hence, we obtain multiple endpoints with predefined data, as in REST, but these are created using GraphQL

As a result, it provides the advantages of both REST and GraphQL at the same time:

| Advantages |
| --- |
| ‚úÖ It provides an editor for the query (GraphiQL) |
| ‚úÖ Accessed via `GET` or `POST` |
| ‚úÖ Can be cached on the server or CDN |
| ‚úÖ It's secure: only intended data is exposed |
| ‚úÖ It can be fast, since all data is retrieved in a single request |
| ‚úÖ It enables rapid iteration of the project |
| ‚úÖ It can be self-documented |

And it eliminates their disadvantages:

### 2. Security

The GraphQL single endpoint, which can return any piece of data accessible through the schema, could potentially allow malicious actors to retrieve private information. Hence, we must implement security measures to protect the data.

The GraphQL API for WordPress provides several mechanisms to protect the data:

üëâüèª We can decide to only expose data through **persisted queries**, and completely disable access through the single endpoint (indeed, it is disabled by default).

üëâüèª We can create **custom endpoints**, each tailored to different users (such as one or another client).

üëâüèª We can set permissions to each field in the schema through **Access Control Lists**, defining rules such as: Is the user logged-in or not? Does the user have a certain role or capability? or any custom rule.

üëâüèª We can define the API to be either **public or private**. In the public API, the fields in the schema are exposed, and when the permission is not satisfied, the user gets a corresponding error message. In the private API, the schema is customized to every user, containing only the fields available to him or her.

## Quick overview of the features

Here an overview of the features shipped with the first version of the plugin.

### GraphiQL and GraphiQL Explorer

[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) is a user-friendly client to create GraphQL queries.

The [GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer) is an interactive tool attached to GraphiQL, that allows to create the query by clicking on fields.

These 2 tools are embedded in the plugin, to make it very eays to create the queries:

### Interactive schema

[GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) is a tool that enables to explore the GraphQL schema:

![Interactive schema](/images/interactive-schema.gif "Interactive schema")

### Persisted queries

As already explained.

### Custom endpoints

A custom endpoint with a specific schema configuration can be created for any target, such as:

- A specific client or group of users
- A specific application, like mobile app or website
- Interacting with some 3rd-party API
- etc

The custom endpoint is a Custom Post Type, and its slug becomes the endpoint. An endpoint with title `"My endpoint"` and slug `my-endpoint` will:

- be accessible under `/graphql/my-endpoint/`
- Expose its own GraphiQL client under `/graphql/my-endpoint/?view=graphiql`
- Expose its own Interactive schema client under `/graphql/my-endpoint/?view=schema`

![Custom endpoint's interactive schema visualizer](/images/custom-endpoint-interactive-schema.png "Custom endpoint's interactive schema visualize")

### Schema configurations

Every custom endpoint and persisted query can select a schema configuration, containing the sets of Access Control Lists, HTTP Caching rules, and Field Deprecation entries (and other features, provided by extensions) to be applied on the endpoint.

![Creating a new schema configuration](/images/schema-configuration.png "Creating a new schema configuratio")

### Access control

We define permissions to access every field and directive in the schema through Access Control Lists. Shipped in the plugin are the following rules:

- Disable access
- Grant access if the user is logged-in or out
- Grant access if the user has some role
- Grant access if the user has some capability

New custom rules can be added:

- Grant access by IP
- Grant access by header/value present in the request
- Grant access if user is PRO
- Grant access on weekends only
- Anything

![Creating an Access Control List](/images/access-control.gif "Creating an Access Control List")

### Public/private API

When access to some a field or directive is defined, there are 2 ways for the API to behave:

- Public API: Provide an error message to the user, indicating why access is denied. This behavior makes the metadata from the schema always available.
- Private API: The error message indicates that the field or directive does not exist. This behavior exposes the metadata from the schema only to those users who can access it.

![Public/Private schema](/images/public-private-schema.gif "Public/Private schema")

### HTTP caching

Because it sends the queries via `POST`, GraphQL is normally not cacheable on the server-side or intermediate stages, such a CDN.

However, persisted queries can be accessed via `GET`, hence we can cache their response.

The max-age value is defined on a field and directive-basis. The response will send a `Cache-Control` header with the lowest max-age value from all the requested fields and directives, or `no-store` if either any field or directive has max-age: `0`, or if access control must check the user state for any field or directive.

### Field deprecation

The plugin provides a user interface to deprecate fields, and indicate how they must be replaced.

![Field deprecation](/images/field-deprecation.gif "Field deprecation")

### Query inheritance

Persisted queries (and also custom endpoints) can declare a parent persisted query, from which it can inherit its properties: its schema configuration and its GraphQL query.

Inheritance is useful for creating a hierarchy of API endpoints, such as:

- `/graphql/clients/client-A/`
- `/graphql/clients/client-B/`
- ...

In this hierarchy, we are able to define the query only on the parent `clients` persisted query, and then each child persisted query, `client-A` and `client-B`, will obtain the query from the parent, and define only its schema configuration, as to set the custom access control rules for each client.

Children queries can also override variables defined in the parent query. For instance, we can generate this structure:

- `/graphql/langs/english/`
- `/graphql/langs/french/`
- ...

The GraphQL query in `langs` can have variable `$lang`, which is then set in each of the children queries with the value for the language: `"en"` and `"fr"`.

![Field deprecation](/images/api-inheritance.gif "Field deprecation")

### Namespacing

When different plugins use the same name for a type or interface, there will be a conflict in the schema. Namespacing avoids this situation, by prepending a unique namespace to the types and schemas.

For instance, if WooCommerce and EasyDigitalDownloads both implement a type `Product`, there there will be a conflict. With namespacing enabled, these become `Automattic_WooCommerce_Product` and `SandhillsDevelopment_EasyDigitalDownloads_Product`, and the conflict is resolved.

## Q&A

Here a response to some questions I've received:

### Is it ready for production?

In theory yes, but since I've just launched the plugin, you'd better test if for some time to make sure there are no issues.

In addition, please be aware that the GraphQL API requires several external components, which must be scoped to avoid potential problems with a different version of the same component being used by another plugin in the site, but this scoping [must yet be done](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api/issues/9). 

Hence, test the plugin in your development environment first, and with all other plugins also activated. If you run into any trouble, please [create an issue](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api/issues/new).

### Can I use it with WooCommerce/ACF?

Yes, you can, because the GraphQL API for WordPress supports integration with any plugin (i.e. creating the corresponding types, and resolvers for the fields). But, this integration must still be done!

### Can I use with Gatsby?

In theory yes, you can, but I don't know why you'd want to do that, at least right now: Jason Bahl, the creator of WPGraphQL, works for Gatsby, so relying on WPGraphQL makes more sense.

### Who can use it?

Hopefully, everyone! Even though GraphQL involves technical concepts, I've worked hard to make the plugin be as user-friendly as possible.

Following the ethos from WordPress, this plugin attempts to allow anyone, i.e. bloggers, designers, marketers, salesmen, and everyone else, to be able to create an API in a simple way:

- Composing the GraphQL query by clicking on fields, and hitting "Publish"
- Granting access to the API by clicking on fields and selecting what access control rules to apply

This is, I believe, "democratizing data publishing".

### Can I seamlessly switch from WPGraphQL to GraphQL API?

Not so much. Ideally, you should be able to keep your existing GraphQL queries, and just change the engine processing them, from WPGraphQL to the GraphQL API. But this doesn't work, because the shape of the schema provided by both plugins is different. 

Some differences include:

- A different name for the same field, such as `postTags` instead of `tags`.
- A different set of arguments to a field, such as `where` to query the `posts` field
- WPGraphQL uses the Relay spec for edge and node data, while GraphQL API doesn't

Hence, to do the switch, you would have to rewrite the GraphQL queries.

### What's the status of the plugin?

GraphQL API is stable and, I'd dare say, ready for production (that is, after playing with it in development). But some things are not complete yet:

- [The documentation for the shipped modules](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api/issues/11). I'm working on them currently, so they should be ready soon.
- [Scoping of the external PHP dependencies](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api/issues/9). I'll work on this issue then.

When these two issues are resolved, I may already upload the GraphQL API plugin to the WordPress plugin repository, if feedback from users is encouraging.

Then, the schema must be upgraded, with:

- Categories
- Menus
- Options
- Meta values

Finally, GraphQL API does not currently support mutations. It must also be implemented.

## Parting thoughts

WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, because it makes it easy to anyone to create and publish content.

GraphQL is steadily becoming the most popular API solution, because it makes it easy to access the data from a website.

I believe that the GraphQL API for WordPress manages to integrate these 2 together seamlessly, and combining their characteristics: to make it easy to anyone to expose and access their data.
