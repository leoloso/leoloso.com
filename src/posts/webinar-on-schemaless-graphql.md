I will be presenting a [webinar on the “schemaless” GraphQL](https://nomadjs.com/live/kSk2ymG1OgnfnDchrCuVp/Introduction-to-the--schemaless--GraphQL/) on November 13th at 6 pm PST. To watch it, it's necessary to have an account with [NomadJS](https://nomadjs.com), however it is free to create one.

If you want to find out what this whole “schemaless” GraphQL thing is about, come join me!
