I have recently introduced the [PoP API for GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql), which I call a [‚Äúschemaless‚Äù implementation of GraphQL](/posts/intro-to-schemaless-graphql-api-for-pop/), and then [described some of its advantages](/posts/bettering-graphql-through-components/) over a typical implementation of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). In this blog post, I will demonstrate some of its superpowers by implementing a slightly-complex yet very standard use case. Along the way, I will explain how it works.

### Use case to implement

You want to create an automated email-sending service to distribute your blog posts. All the data comes from 3 separate sources:

1. A REST API endpoint returning the subscribers (pairs of `email` and `language` fields) to the newsletter, provided by Mailchimp.
2. A REST API endpoint with all your customer information, including their `email` and `name` fields, provided by company's CRM.
3. The blog posts published in your website.

The email needs to be customized for each person:

1. Greeting them personally by name
2. Translating the content of the email to their own language. Using Google Translate is acceptable.

The service needs to be flexible, allowing to select the post(s) to send:

1. By providing the ID of the post
2. By providing a query to select the post, such as "latest published one"

The service will be accessed by 2 different kinds of stakeholders: 

1. Company employees, to be granted unrestricted access to all features
2. Company contractors, to be granted restricted access to certain features

Your requirements change over time, so the service will ocassionally need to implement new features. However, you do not have the budget to employ a permanent back-end developer to maintain the service in the long-term. Hence, adding new features to the service must not involve custom code (eg: providing new fields into the API).

Finally, the team members implementing the service work remotely and from different timezones, so you need to minimize their need for interaction.

### Steps to follow

Our service will follow the following steps:

1. Fetch the list of newsletter subscribers using the first API endpoint, getting their `email` and `language` fields
2. For every recipient in this list add the `name` field, fetching it from the second API endpoint by using the common `email` field as ID. 

By now, we will have the all the user data consolidated in a single list, containing fields `name`, `email` and `language`. Let's continue.

3. Retrieve the data for the specified blog post: `content` and `date`
4. Calculate all the different languages that the post needs be translated to
5. Translate the post to each language

By now, in addition to the user data, we will also have the post data, translated to all required languages. Next, we need to craft the customized email content for each user.

6. Iterate the list of users, and for each add a new field `emailContent` containing:
  a. The greeting message "Hi {name}, this is our our blog post from {date}", translated to the user's language
  b. The blog post content that had been translated to the user's language

By now, we have all the data: Rows of `email` and `emailContent` fields. We can finally send the email.

7. Iterate the list, and send the email

### Explaining some concepts

Before we start the implementation of the use case, I will explain a few concepts particular to PoP.

#### URL-based queries

While the standard GraphQL sends the query contained in the body of the request, PoP sends it as a URL parameter. This has the following advantages:

- It enables server-side caching
- It removes the need for a client-side library to manipulate the query, leading to performance improvements and reduced amount of code to maintain
- The API becomes easier to consume. For instance, we can visualize the results of the query directly on the browser, without depending on GraphiQL

#### Similar but different query syntax

The syntax used in PoP is a re-imagining of the GraphQL syntax, supporting all the required elements (field names, arguments, variables, aliases, fragments and directives), however designed to be easy to both read and write in a single line, so the developer can already code the query in the browser without depending on special tooling.

It looks like this:

```
fieldName(fieldArgs)@alias<fieldDirective(directiveArgs)>
```

To make it clearer to code, the query can be split into several lines:

```
fieldName(
  fieldArgs
)@alias<
  fieldDirective(
    directiveArgs
  )
>
```

The syntax is described in detail in [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/getpop/field-query). I will keep explaining how it works below, while implementing the use case.

> **Note:**<br/>Firefox already handles the multi-line query: Copy/pasting it into the URL bar works perfectly. Chrome and Safari, though, require to strip all the whitespaces and line returns before pasting the query into the URL bar.
> 
> (Conclusion: use Firefox!)

#### Operators

Standard operations, such as `not`, `or`, `and`, `if`, `equals`, `isNull`, `sprintf` and many others, can be made available on the API as fields:

```
1. ?query=not(true)
2. ?query=or([true,false])
3. ?query=and([true,false])
4. ?query=if(true, Show this text, Hide this text)
5. ?query=equals(first text, second text)
6. ?query=isNull(),isNull(something)
7. ?query=sprintf(%s API is %s, [PoP, cool])
```

[<a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=not(true)">Query 1</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=or([true,false])">Query 2</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=and([true,false])">Query 3</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=if(true,Show this text,Hide this text)">Query 4</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=equals(first text, second text)">Query 5</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=isNull(),isNull(something)">Query 6</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=sprintf(API %s is %s, [PoP, cool])">Query 7</a>]

#### Nested Fields

Arguments passed to a field can include other fields or operators.

```
1. ?query=posts.has-comments|not(has-comments())
2. ?query=posts.has-comments|has-featuredimage|or([has-comments(), has-featuredimage()])
3. ?query=posts.if(has-comments(), sprintf(Post with title '%s' has %s comments, [title(), comments-count()]), sprintf(Post with ID %s was created on %s, [id(), date(d/m/Y)]))@postDesc
4. ?query=posts.comments(limit:divide(comments-count(), 2)).id|date|content
5. ?query=users.name|equals(name(), leo)
```

[<a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.has-comments|not(has-comments())">Query 1</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.has-comments|has-featuredimage|or([has-comments(),has-featuredimage()])">Query 2</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.if(has-comments(),sprintf(Post with title '%s' has %s comments,[title(),comments-count()]),sprintf(Post with ID %s was created on %s,[id(),date(d/m/Y)]))@postDesc">Query 3</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.comments(limit:divide(comments-count(),2)).id|date|content">Query 4</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=users.name|equals(name(),leo)">Query 5</a>)]


### Implementing the Query (with explanations along the way)

Time to implement the query! I promise this is going to be fun (at least, I certainly enjoyed doing it). Along the way I will explain how/why it works.

Let's start.

**Fetching the blog post**

```
?query=
  post($postId)@post.
    echo([
      content:content(),
      date:date(d/m/Y)
    ])@postData,
```
