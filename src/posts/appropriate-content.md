After a couple of years submitting my articles to [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com), I have gained some experience into what I can propose to write, and what will certainly not work. I don't know the specifics of other publications, but Smashing Magazine has have very [high standards](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/editorial-process/), so if a proposed article is not well-thought of, well-explained or well-executed, it will certainly not be published. Hence, before submitting a proposal, I always make sure that the article is somehow valuable to the community and worth publishing. If it is not, I don't bother sending it over, since it will be a waste of time to all involved parties. 

If you are considering writing an article for some respectable magazine, I can offer the following advices.

The article cannot be all about you or your product! If you want to brag how your technology is solving all the problems in the world, or describe how your company is undercutting its rivals and making huge profits, I'm sure your company's stakeholders will be pleased with that information and will welcome you to write a blog post on your company's social media accounts. But not many people outside your company will care, and nobody likes reading self-praising stuff, so don't expect to publish such an account on a respectable magazine.

However, that doesn't mean that you can't talk about you or your products, but simply to not try to be the hero of the story. Your article can still describe your products or services as long as there's something in it for the readers as readers, instead of the readers as consumers. For instance, if you have a cloud solution that optimizes images, you can perfectly explain why your strategy achieves an optimal rate of compression and how it works, or you could also give an account on why the newly-supported format WebP is more efficient than JPEG, and while doing so mention that your services offer support for WebP. 

An effective way to reconcile what you want to promote with giving value to readers, is to continuously ask yourself "What is it in it for them"? Make sure that you can reply this question on every section of your article. If you can't, then that section must be edited or even removed. If nothing stands, well, then it's time to kill the article, which wouldn't get approved by the editors anyway.
