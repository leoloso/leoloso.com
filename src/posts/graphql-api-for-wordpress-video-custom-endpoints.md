The upcoming GraphQL API for WordPress plugin (to be released this May!) allows to create multiple GraphQL endpoints, each of them with a different configuration, as to expose only the require data, add a corresponding access control strategy, set-up specific cache max-age values, and others.

For instance, we can create endpoints:

- `/graphql/website`
- `/graphql/mobile-app`
- `/graphql/client-this-one`
- `/graphql/client-that-one`

Each endpoint is attached its own GraphiQL (under `/?view=graphiql`) to execute queries, and Voyager (under `?view=schema`) to visualize the endpoint's schema (each endpoint can be configured to access only a sub-schema, i.e. certain parts from the grand schema).
