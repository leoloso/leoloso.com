2 days ago I subscribed to GitHub sponsors to fund my work on the [GraphQL API for WordPress](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp), and I already got [my first sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/leoloso/)!

Following the example set by Caleb Porzio (who's making [more than u$d 100k/y doing open source](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it)), I have decided to use the [sponsorware model](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware) to fund my project. It works like this:

- Whenever I get 10 new sponsors (at u$d 14/m), I start developing the most up-voted feature from a special ["Sponsorware" list](https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp/projects/2) (which I'm completing as I'm writing this milestone)
- Once implemented, the new feature becomes available to all the sponsors, via a private GitHub repo
- As soon as I get 50 new sponsors, the new feature becomes open source, accessible to everyone via the public GitHub repo, and is integrated into the plugin

In a few months, I will also start creating instructional videos, explaining how to make the most out of the plugin. According to Caleb, this is the biggest money-making strategy.

I have also decided to add a middle tier (at u$d 70/m), where I provide Slack-based personal support, to help users of my plugin set-up GraphQL with WordPress, troubleshooting, and answering their questions. A user needed help to develop a functionality, so he decided to sponsor me <= my first sponsor ❤️

Finally, I added a higher tier (at u$d 700) for corporate sponsors. I plan to ask around in the WordPress community if their companies may be interested in participating. That would be a win-win: They get plenty of face from contributing to open source, and I get the certainty that I can make a living wage from my work and can focus on the development of the plugin (and not on marketing, which is not my forte).

I hope the sponsorware model works, and I can make a living while working on open source. I'll keep writing updates on how it goes, here on my blog, and [on IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/leoloso).
