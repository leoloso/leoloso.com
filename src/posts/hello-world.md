Howdy friends! It took some time, but finally I have my own blog on my own domain, leoloso.com. Hurray! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

I will be blogging about those small things that I encounter every day when coding on PoP, attending events, working on random projects, reading a book, or anything that is noteworthy. I hope you enjoy it!
