Alright, I just finished my slides for the [NomadJS webinar](https://nomadjs.com/live/kSk2ymG1OgnfnDchrCuVp/Introduction-to-the--schemaless--GraphQL/) that I presented yesterday (yeah, I finished them 1 day later!), but if you take a look at them, you may understand why... There's sooooo much stuff here! If I'm proud of anything, this is it!

I have listed down all the features that I have implemented for the PoP API, an implementation of GraphQL that gets rid of the SDL (Schema Definition Language) completely, and extracts and generates the schema from the data model defined in the application code. It may sound difficult, but it's actually so easy: The developer doesn't need to do much! Everything pretty much just works!

If you want to find out what I'm talking about, please check the slides (if they bore you, just skip to slide #24 and check the features... I promise that will be fun):

If after checking these slides you want to find out a bit more, please read my [previous blog post](/posts/demonstrating-pop-api-graphql-on-steroids/), in which I give a step-by-step explanation of how a rather complex use case is resolved with a single query. It's a bit long, but hopefully it will be worth your time.

Let me know how it goes :)
