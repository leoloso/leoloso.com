I have recently introduced the [PoP API for GraphQL](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql), an [implementation of GraphQL in PHP](/posts/intro-to-schemaless-graphql-api-for-pop/), and then [described some of its advantages](/posts/bettering-graphql-through-components/) over a typical implementation of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). In this blog post, I will demonstrate some of its superpowers by implementing a slightly-complex yet very standard use case. Along the way, I will explain how it works.

### Use case to implement

You want to create an automated email-sending service to distribute your blog posts. All the data comes from 3 separate sources:

1. A REST API endpoint returning the subscribers (pairs of `email` and `language` fields) to the newsletter, provided by Mailchimp.
2. A REST API endpoint with all your customer information, including their `email` and `name` fields, provided by company's CRM.
3. The blog posts published in your website.

The email needs to be customized for each person:

1. Greeting them personally by name
2. Translating the content of the email to their own language. Using Google Translate is acceptable.

The service needs to be flexible, allowing to select the post(s) to send:

1. By providing the ID of the post
2. By providing a query to select the post, such as "latest published one"

The service will be accessed by 2 different kinds of stakeholders: 

1. Company employees, to be granted unrestricted access to all features
2. Company contractors, to be granted restricted access to certain features

Your requirements change over time, so the service will ocassionally need to implement new features. However, you do not have the budget to employ a permanent back-end developer to maintain the service in the long-term. Hence, adding new features to the service must not involve custom code (eg: providing new fields into the API).

Finally, the team members implementing the service work remotely and from different timezones, so you need to minimize their need for interaction.

### Steps to follow

Our service will follow the following steps:

1. Fetch the list of newsletter subscribers using the first API endpoint, getting their `email` and `language` fields
2. For every recipient in this list add the `name` field, fetching it from the second API endpoint by using the common `email` field as ID. 

By now, we will have the all the user data consolidated in a single list, containing fields `name`, `email` and `language`. Let's continue.

3. Retrieve the data for the specified blog post: `content` and `date`
4. Calculate all the different languages that the post needs be translated to
5. Translate the post to each language

By now, in addition to the user data, we will also have the post data, translated to all required languages. Next, we need to craft the customized email content for each user.

6. Iterate the list of users, and for each add a new field `emailContent` containing:
  a. The greeting message "Hi {name}, this is our our blog post from {date}", translated to the user's language
  b. The blog post content that had been translated to the user's language

By now, we have all the data: Rows of `email` and `emailContent` fields. We can finally send the email.

7. Iterate the list, and send the email

### Before starting: Let's explore some core concepts

Before we start the implementation of the use case, I will explain a few concepts particular to PoP.

#### URL-based queries

While the standard GraphQL sends the query contained in the body of the request, PoP sends it as a URL parameter. This has the following advantages:

- It enables server-side caching
- It removes the need for a client-side library to manipulate the query, leading to performance improvements and reduced amount of code to maintain
- The API becomes easier to consume. For instance, we can visualize the results of the query directly on the browser, without depending on GraphiQL

```php
?query=...
```

#### Similar but different query syntax

The syntax used in PoP is a re-imagining of the GraphQL syntax, supporting all the required elements (field names, arguments, variables, aliases, fragments and directives), however designed to be easy to both read and write in a single line, so the developer can already code the query in the browser without depending on special tooling.

It looks like this:

```php
?query=query1,query2,query3&variable1=value&fragment1=fragmentQuery
```

Each query has this shape:

```php
fieldName(fieldArgs)@alias<fieldDirective(directiveArgs)>
```

To make it clear to visualize, the query can be split into several lines:

```php
fieldName(
  fieldArgs
)@alias<
  fieldDirective(
    directiveArgs
  )
>
```

> **Note 1:**<br/>Firefox already handles the multi-line query: Copy/pasting it into the URL bar works perfectly. Chrome and Safari, though, require to strip all the whitespaces and line returns before pasting the query into the URL bar.
> 
> (Conclusion: use Firefox!)

> **Note 2:**<br/>
> The syntax is described in detail in [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/getpop/field-query). I will keep explaining how it works below, while implementing the use case.

#### Operators

Standard operations, such as `not`, `or`, `and`, `if`, `equals`, `isNull`, `sprintf` and many others, are supported as fields:

```php
1. ?query=not(true)
2. ?query=or([1,0])
3. ?query=and([1,0])
4. ?query=if(true, Show this text, Hide this text)
5. ?query=equals(first text, second text)
6. ?query=isNull(),isNull(something)
7. ?query=sprintf(%s API is %s, [PoP, cool])
```

[View query results: <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=not(true)">query #1</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=or([1,0])">query #2</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=and([1,0])">query #3</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=if(true,Show this text,Hide this text)">query #4</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=equals(first text, second text)">query #5</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=isNull(),isNull(something)">query #6</a>, <a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql?query=sprintf(%s API is %s, [PoP, cool])">query #7</a>]

#### Composable fields

Arguments passed to a field can receive other fields or operators as input.

```php
?query=
  posts.
    if (
      has-comments(), 
      sprintf(
        "Post with ID %s has %s comment(s) and title '%s'", 
        [
          id(),
          comments-count(),
          title()
        ]
      ), 
      sprintf(
        "Post with ID %s, created on %s, has no comments", 
        [
          id(), 
          date(d/m/Y)
        ]
      )
    )@postDesc
```

[<a href="https://nextapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts.if(has-comments(),sprintf(Post with ID %s has %s comment(s) and title '%s',[id(),comments-count(),title()]),sprintf(%22Post with ID %s, created on %s, has no comments%22,[id(),date(d/m/Y)]))@postDesc">View query results</a>]

### Composable directives

A directive can modify the behaviour of another directive. Values can be passed from one to another through "expressions": special variables set by each directive, wrapped with `%...%`.

For instance, in the example below, directive `<forEach>` iterates through all the items in an array, passing each of them to its composed directive `<applyFunction>` through expression `%value%`.

```php
echo([
  [banana, apple],
  [strawberry, grape, melon]
])@fruitJoin<
  forEach<
    applyFunction(
      function: arrayJoin,
      addArguments: [
        array: %value%,
        separator: "---"
      ]
    )
  >
>
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=echo([[banana,apple],[strawberry,grape,melon]])@fruitJoin%3CforEach%3CapplyFunction(function:arrayJoin,addArguments: [array:%value%,separator:%22---%22])%3E%3E">View query results</a>]

### Implementing the Query

Time to implement the query! I promise this is going to be fun (at least, I certainly enjoyed doing it). Along the way I will explain how/why it works.

Let's start.

> **Note:**<br/>At any time, you can review the documentation for the fields/directives employed by querying the [fullSchema](https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=fullSchema) field.

#### Fetching the blog post

We can query field `posts` to find the latest published blog post:

```php
posts(
  limit:1, 
  order:date|DESC
).
  id|
  title|
  url
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=posts(limit:1,order:date|DESC).id|title|url">View query results</a>]

> **Note 1:**<br/> Use `,` to separate field arguments, each of them in `key:value` format

> **Note 2:**<br/> Use `.` to fetch nested properties from the object

> **Note 3:**<br/> Use `|` to fetch several fields from an object

This query retrieves an array of posts. To operate with a single post, we can better use field `post`, which receives the ID by argument:

```php
post(
  id:1
).
  id|
  title|
  url
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=post(id:1).id|title|url">View query results</a>]

Fields argument names are optional. The query above is similar to the one below, which skips fieldArg name `"id"`:

```php
post(1).
  id|
  title|
  url
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=post(1).id|title|url">View query results</a>]

We can pass the ID through a variable, which is resolved through a URL parameter under the variable name. For the query below, we add param `postId=1` to the URL:

```php
post($postId).
  id|
  title|
  url
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId).id|title|url">View query results</a>]

> **Note:**<br/>Use `$` to define a variable

Finally, we add an alias to make the response more compact:

```php
post($postId)@post.
  id|
  title|
  url
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.id|title|url">View query results</a>]

> **Note:**<br/>Use `@` to define an alias

#### Fetching the blog post (again)

The previous queries were demonstrating how to fetch data for the post. Now that we know, let's fetch the data needed for our use case: the `content` and `date` fields:

```php
post($postId)@post.
  content|
  date(d/m/Y)@date
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date">View query results</a>]

> **Note:**<br/>Use `[...]` to define an array and `,` to separate its items. The format for each item is either `key:value` or `value` (making the key numeric)

#### Fetching the list of newsletter subscribers

To fetch the list of newsletter subscribers from a REST endpoint, we can use field `getJSON` and specify the URL:

```php
getJSON("https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions")@userList
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList">View query results</a>]

#### Calculating the list of unique languages

The previous list contains pairs of `email` and `lang` fields. Next, we calculate the list of unique languages, as to translate the blog post to all those languages. This task will be composed of two steps.

First, we extract the field `lang` from the array through field `extract` (which takes an array and a path):

```php
getJSON("https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions")@userList|
extract(
  getSelfProp(%self%, userList),
  lang
)
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang)">View query results</a>]

> **Note:**<br/>Expression `%self%` contains an object which has a pointer to all data retrieved for the current object. Accessed through function `getSelfProp`, it enables to access this data, under the property name or alias under which it was stored.

Then, we apply operator `arrayUnique`, and assign the results under alias `userLangs`:

```php
getJSON("https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions")@userList|
arrayUnique(
  extract(
    getSelfProp(%self%, userList),
    lang
  )
)@userLangs
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs">View query results</a>]

#### Retrieving the rest of the user information

So far, we have a list of pairs of `email` and `lang` fields stored under property `userList`. Next, using `email` as the common identifier for the data, we query the REST endpoint from the CRM to fetch the remaining user information: the `name` field. This task is composed of several steps.

First, we extract the list of all emails from `userList`, and place them under `userEmails`:

```php
extract(
  getSelfProp(%self%, userList),
  email
)@userEmails
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails">View query results</a>]

Our CRM exposes a REST endpoint which allows to filter users by email, like this:

```php
/users/api/rest/?emails[]=email1&emails[]=email2&...
```

Then, we must generate the endpoint URL by converting the array of emails into a string with the right format, and then executing `getJSON` on this URL. Let's do that.

To generate the URL, we use a combination of `sprintf` and `arrayJoin`:

```php
sprintf(
  "https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s",
  [arrayJoin(
    getSelfProp(%self%, userEmails),
    "%26emails[]="
  )]
)
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])">View query results</a>]

> **Note 1:**<br/>The string can't have character `"&"` in it, or it will create trouble when appending it in the URL param. Instead, we must use its code `"%26"`

> **Note 2:**<br/>The REST endpoint used for this example is also satisfied by the PoP API, which combines features of both REST and GraphQL at the same time (eg: the queried resources are `/users/`, and we avoid overfetching by passing `?query=name|email`)

Having generated the URL, we execute `getJSON` on it:

```php
getJSON(
  sprintf(
    "https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s",
    [arrayJoin(
      getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),
      "%26emails[]="
    )]
  )
)
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)]))">View query results</a>]

Finally, we must combine the 2 lists into one, generating a new list containing all user fields: `name`, `email` and `lang`. To achieve this, we use function `arrayFill`, which, given 2 arrays, returns an array containing the entries from each of them where the index (in this case, property `email`) is the same, and we save the results under property `userData`:

```php
arrayFill(
  getJSON(
    sprintf(
      "https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s",
      [arrayJoin(
        getSelfProp(%self%, userEmails),
        "%26emails[]="
      )]
    )
  ),
  getSelfProp(%self%, userList),
  email
)@userData
```

[<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData">View query results</a>]

#### Translating the post content to all different languages

By now we have collected the post data, saved under properties `content` and `date`, and all the user data, saved under property `userData`. It is time to mix these pieces of data together, for which we need to have all data at the same level. However, if we pay attention to the <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData">latest query</a>, we can notice that they are under 2 different paths:

- `userData` is under `/` (root)
- `content` and `date` are under `/post/`

Hence, we must either move `userData` down to the `post` level, or move `content` and `date` up to the root level. Due to PoP's graph dataloading architecture, only the latter option is feasible. The reason is a bit difficult to explain in words, but I'll try my best. (It would be much better to show the process in images, but I'm not great at design in any case.)

#### A digression to explain how data is loaded

(This will be a bit technical. Apologies in advance.)

When resolving the query to load data, the dataloader processes all elements from a same entity all at the same time, as to load all their data in a single query and completely avoiding the N+1 problem. (Indeed, PoP's dataloading mechanism has linear time complexity, or `O(n)`, based on the number of nodes in the graph. That's why it is so fast to load data, even for deeply nested graphs.) Then, let's imagine that we have the following query:

```php
posts.
  title|
  author.
    name
```

Let's say this query returns 10 posts and, for each post, it retrieves its author, and some authors have 2 or more posts, so that the query retrieves 10 posts but only 4 unique authors. The dataloading mechanism will first process all 10 posts, fetching all their required data (properties `title` and `author`), and then it will fetch all data for all 4 authors (property `name`). 

If posts with IDs `1` and `2` both have author with ID `5`, and we copy a property downwards in the graph, post `1` will first copy its properties down to author `5`, then immediately post `2` will copy its own properties down to author `5`, overriding the properties set by post `1`. By the time the dataloading mechanism reaches the users level, author `5` will only have the data from posts `2`. This situation could be avoided by copying the properties the post ID in the user object, as to not override previous values. However, while the post entity knows that it is loading data for its author, the author entity doesn't know who loaded it (the graph direction is only top-to-bottom). Hence, the post entiy can fetch properties from the author entity and store them under theauthor ID (which the post knows about), but the other way around doesn't work.

That's why we can only copy properties upwards. In this case, the post's `content` and `date` properties must be copied upwards, to the root.

We can now go back to the query.

#### Translating the post content to all different languages (again)

To copy the `content` and `date` properties upwards to the root level, we use directive `<copyRelationalResults>`. This directive is applied on the `root` entity, and it receives these inputs:

1. The name of the relational property, in this case `post($postId)@post`
2. The name of the properties to copy, in this case `content` and `date`
3. (Optional) The name under which to copy the properties, in this case `postContent` and `postDate`

```php
self.
  post($postId)@post<
    copyRelationalResults(
      [content, date],
      [postContent, postDate]
    )
  >
```

[View query results: <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">GraphQL output</a>, <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">PoP native output</a>]

That this works is not evident at all. Moreover, you need to click on link <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">PoP native output</a> to see the results, and appreciate that the data was indeed copied one level up. The other link, <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">GraphQL output</a>, would seem to not work... it also does, but the results are not being output!

To understand why this is so, I'll need to take several detours, to explain how data is loaded (once again) and how directives work. 

(Please be aware: the following few sections, until tackling the translation challenge again, are dense and technical. If you dare read them, good for you! If you don't, don't worry, just skip them, you may come back to them later...)

#### What are directives and how do they work

Directives are sheer power: They can affect execution of the query in any desired way. They are as close to the bare metal of the dataloading engine as possible. They have access to all previously loaded data and can modify it, remove it, etc.

Directives help regulate the lifecycle of loading data in the API, by validating and resolving the fields on the objects and adding these results on a directory with all results from all objects, from which the graph is drawn. 

The dataloading engine relies on the following special directives to implement core functionality:

1. `<setSelfAsExpression>`, which defines the "expression" `%self%` which allows to retrieve previously loaded data
2. `<validate>`, which validates that the provided data matches against its definition on the schema and, if it doesn't, removes it and shows a error message
3. `<resolveValueAndMerge>`: it resolves all the fields in the query and merges their response into the final database object

These 3 directives are executed at the beginning of their own slots:

1. Front: `<setSelfAsExpression>`
2. Middle: `<validate>`
3. Back: `<resolveValueAndMerge>`

Every directive we create must indicate in which from these 3 slots it must be placed and executed. For instance, directives `<skip>` and `<include>` (mandatory ones in GraphQL) must be placed in the `"Middle"` slot, that is after fields are validated but before resolved; directive `<copyRelationalProperties>` must be placed in the `"Back"` slot, since it requires the data to be resolved before it can copy it somewhere else.

#### Revisiting how PoP loads data

Let's examine the query above together with the previous query bit that loads properties `content` and `date`:

```php
post($postId)@post.
  content|
  date(d/m/Y)@date,
self.
  post($postId)@post<

We can see that these 2 queries are separated using `,` instead of `|`, and that there is an entity `self` after which we repeat the same field `post($postId)@post`, and only then we apply directive `<copyRelationalResults>`. Why is this so? 

Field `self` is an identity field: It returns the same object currently being operated on. In this case, it returns once again the entity `root`. (Doing `self` returns the `root` object, doing `post.self` returns the same `post` object, doing `post.author.self` returns the `user` object, and so on.) 

As I mentioned before, the dataloader loads data in stages, in which all data for a same type of entity (all posts, all users, etc) is fetched all together. Using `,` to separate a query makes it start iterating from the root all over again. Then, when processing this query...

```php
post,
self.post
``` 

...the entites being handled by the dataloader are these ones, in this exact order: `root` (the first one, always), `posts` (loaded by query `posts`, before the `,`), `root` (the first one again, after `,`), `root` again (loaded by doing `self` on the `root` object) and then `posts` again (by doing `self.post`).

As can be seen, the `self` field then enables to go back to an already loaded object, and keep loading properties on it. As such, it allows to delay loading certain data until a later iteration of the dataloader, to make sure a certain condition is satisfied.

That is exactly why we need it: Directive `<copyRelationalResults>` copies a property one level up, but it is applied on the `root` object and, by the time it is executed, the properties to copy must exist on the `post` object. Hence the iteration: `root` loads the `post`, the `post` loads its properties, then back to `root` copies the properties from the `post` to itself.

#### Concerning the native data structure used in PoP (hint: it's not a graph!)

We saw in the query above...

```php
self.
  post($postId)@post<
    copyRelationalResults(
      [content, date],
      [postContent, postDate]
    )

What is going on?

First of all: the PoP API does NOT use a graph to represent the data model. Instead, it uses components, as I have explained [in this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/introducing-component-based-api/). 

However (and this is the fact that makes the magic happen) a graph does naturally arise from the relationships among the database entities defined through components, which I described in my article. Hence, the graph can be easily generated from the component-based architecture of the API, and the GraphQL implementation is simply an application among many. For instance, if replacing the `/graphql` bit in the URL with `/rest`, we obtain the equivalent REST endpoint (as demonstrated for the REST API endpoint to fetch the user data); if we replace it with `/xml`, we access the data in XML format (<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/xml/?postId=1&query=getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData">example</a>).

The real, underlying data structure in PoP is simply a set of relationships across database objects, which matches directly with how an SQL database works: Tables containing rows of data entries, and relationships among entities defined through IDs. That is exactly what you see when you remove the `/graphql` bit from the URL, from any URL (<a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">example</a>). That's the PoP native format. Looking at is like looking at the code in the matrix.

![This is how removing /graphql feels like. Image source: huffpost.com](/images/matrix.jpg "This is how removing /graphql feels like. Image source: huffpost.com")

The developer needs not define schemas, and certainly need not deal with the SDL. Instead, it's all about defining the relationships among the different database entities in the application, which will quite likely already exist! Just by replicating the relationships already defined in the data model, we can obtain the GraphQL schema for free, automatically generated from the component model itself, and visualized by [querying the `fullSchema` field](https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?query=fullSchema).

Finally, we can provide an explanation of why the query results in <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">PoP native output</a> for directive `<copyRelationalResults>` are shown, but not in the <a href="https://newapi.getpop.org/api/graphql/?postId=1&query=post($postId)@post.content|date(d/m/Y)@date,getJSON(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/wp-json/newsletter/v1/subscriptions%22)@userList|arrayUnique(extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),lang))@userLangs|extract(getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userEmails|arrayFill(getJSON(sprintf(%22https://newapi.getpop.org/users/api/rest/?query=name|email%26emails[]=%s%22,[arrayJoin(getSelfProp(%self%,userEmails),%22%26emails[]=%22)])),getSelfProp(%self%,userList),email)@userData,self.post($postId)@post%3CcopyRelationalResults([content,%20date],[postContent,%20postDate])%3E">GraphQL output</a>: The PoP native format displays all the data it has accumulated, thereby there it is.

#### Translating the post content to all different languages (again x2)

Oh boy, that was quite a ride! But now we're finally back to business... Let's continue implementing the query!

We have by now properties `postContent`, `postDate` and `userData` all loaded at the root level, which is all the information we need to work with. From now on, being at the root level we can execute all the operators and directives necessary to accomplish our goals.

Next, we apply directive `<translate>` on `postContent`, which will call the Google Translate API to translate the text. Why is it a directive, instead of an operator? Let's take a quick detour to explain the differences between these two.

#### Differences between directives and operators

When coding a query, it may be sometimes unclear what is better, if to use an operator or use a directive. After all, the two of them can both execute functionality (such as sending an email, or translating a piece of text). For instance, we could do either `posts.translate(title)` (operator) or `posts.title<translate>` (directive). So, when to use one or the other?

When executing functionality, the main difference between these 2 is the following:

An operator is a field. A field computes a value from a single object; every field is executed independently of each other field, and it is executed once per object. For instance, for the following query...

```php
post.
  title
```

... the field `title` is executed once on each post object. If there are 10 posts, then `title` is executed 10 times, once in each. And they see no history: given a set of inputs, they just return their output. They don't have really a lot of logic, or complexity.

Since operators are fields, we have the same situation: For the following query...

```php
post.
  sprintf(
    "Post title is", 
    [title()]
  )
```

... the `sprintf` operator is executed once in each `title` property, which is executed 10 times, once per post, all independently from each other, and oblivious of each other.

Directives work in a different way: They are executed just once on the set of affected objects, and on the set of affected properties for each object, and they can modify the value of these properties for each of the objects. For instance, for the following query:

```php
posts.
  title<
    applyFunction(...)
  >|
  content<
    applyFunction(...)
  >
```

... the directive `<applyFunction>` will be executed only once (even if it appears twice in the query, once for each field), receiving a set of posts and properties `title` and `content` for each post.

Hence, we must use directives when:

- It is more efficient to batch execute operations. For instance, a `<sendByEmail>` directive sending 10 emails at once is more effective than a `sendByEmail()` operator sending 10 emails independently, and making 10 SMTP connections; a `<translate>` directive can make a single call to the translation API to translate all strings at once, which is more efficient than calling `translate()` on 10 strings which will make 10 calls to the translation API.
- We need low-level functionality, such as: modifying or deleting previous data, copying data to another object, iterating through a series of properties to apply a function to each of them, etc.

#### Translating the post content to all different languages (again x3)

Now we know why we are doing `content<translate>` instead of `translate(content)`. Let's continue.

The following query takes care of translating the post content to all the different unique languages gathered earlier on from the user data:

```php
self.
  self.
    getSelfProp(%self%, postContent)@postContent<
      translate(
        from:en,
        to:arrayDiff([
          getSelfProp(%self%, userLangs),
          [en]
        ])
      )
    >
```

We can see that the `<translate>` directive takes 2 inputs through directive arguments: the `from` language (English) and the `to` language or array of languages. Since we want to translate to many languages, we provide this list, but first removing English from the list (through operator `arrayDiff`). Otherwise, the Google Translate API throws an error when attempting to translate from English to English.

The `<translate>` directive did not override the original property on the object, but instead created additional ones which append the language code. Hence, by now, we have the following entries with the post content: `postContent` (original in English), `postContent-es` (Spanish), `postContent-fr` (French) and `postContent-de` (German). To homogenize it, we rename property `postContent` to `postContent-en` through directive `<renameProperty>`:

```php
self.
  self.
    getSelfProp(%self%,postContent)@postContent<
      translate(
        from:en,
        to:arrayDiff([
          getSelfProp(%self%, userLangs),
          [en]
        ])
      ),
      renameProperty(postContent-en)
    >
```

> **Note:**<br/>When applying more than 1 directive to the same affected objects and fields, we can simply concatenate them with `,` in the order in which they will be executed, as in `<translate(...), renameProperty(...)>`. 
> 
> However, because a directive is executed on its selected slot from among `"Front"`, `"Middle"` and `"Back"`, only the order within the slot will always be respected. It may be that defining `<directive1, directive2>` will have `<directive2>` execute before than `<directive1>` if its slot is executed earlier.

#### Selecting the corresponding translation for each user

By now, we have translated the post content to all different unique languages. Next, let's add the corresponding translation for each user, creating a new property `userPostData`.

To achieve this, we will make use of directive `<forEach>` which iterates over an array, and passes each array item to its composed directive `<applyFunction>` through expression `%value%`. This directive then executes function `arrayAddItem` on each item, which adds an element (the translated post content) to an array (the user data). In order to deduce the selected language, it uses functions `extract` to get the `lang` property from the user data array, then injects it into `sprintf` to generate the corresponding `postContent-languagecode` property, which is then retrieved from the current object (the root) and placed under property `postContent` on the array. All field arguments needed by function `arrayAddItem` are injected by the directive `<applyFunction>` on runtime through the array defined in argument `addArguments`.

```php
self.
  self.
    getSelfProp(%self%, userData)@userPostData<
      forEach<
        applyFunction(
          function: arrayAddItem(
            array: [],
            value: ""
          ),
          addArguments: [
            key: postContent,
            array: %value%,
            value: getSelfProp(
              %self%,
              sprintf(
                postContent-%s,
                [extract(%value%,lang)]
              )
            )
          ]
        )
      >

> **Note:**<br/>Function `arrayAddItem` still initially defines field arguments `array` and `value`, even if initialized with empty values. This must be done because these arguments are set as mandatory in the schema definition, so if they are not present, it is considered a schema validation error and this section of the query is ignored.

#### Adding a greeting message, and translating it to the user's language

Let's next deal with the greeting message, which must be translated to the user's language. Initially the message is a placeholder, and we customize it through the user `name` field and the post `date` field. Only then we can do the translation, as to help Google Translate do a better job at it (translating "Hi Leo!" should produce better results than translating "Hi %s!")

We first add the message into the array containing all other user data under property `header`, and already customizing it with the user data. The logic is similar as in the previous query, for which we also use directive `<applyFunction>`, which can be executed within the same iteration of the previous `<forEach>` directive:

```php
self.
  self.
    getSelfProp(%self%, userData)@userPostData<
      forEach<
        applyFunction(
          function: arrayAddItem(
            array: [],
            value: ""
          ),
          addArguments: [
            key: header,
            array: %value%,
            value: sprintf(
              string: "<p>Hi %s, we published this post on %s, enjoy!</p>",
              values: [
                extract(%value%, name),
                getSelfProp(%self%, postDate)
              ]
            )
          ]
        )
      >

Finally, we translate the message to the user's language. To do this, we use directive `<forEach>` to iterate on all array items whose `lang` field is `"en"` (for English), since we don't want to translate those. This is accomplished through the filter condition passed through argument `if`. Then, each array item is passed to the composed directive `<advancePointerInArray>`, which can navigate the inner structure of the array and position itself on the property that needs be translated: `header`. 

Finally the element is passed to the next composed directive, `<translate>`, which receives a string of arrays to translate as its affected fields, and an array of languages to translate to passed through expression `toLang` (which we create on-the-fly just for this purpose of communicating data across directives), and by setting argument `oneLanguagePerField` to `true` and `override` to `true` the directive knows to match each element on these 2 arrays to do the translation and place the result back on the original property.

#### Generating and sending the email

We are almost there! All that there is left to do is to generate the content for all the emails to send: arrays containing properties `content`, `to` and `subject`, and then this array is passed to directive `<sendByEmail>` which, voilÃ , does what it must do! (Or actually not: Since I don't like spam, the email sending is actually disabled... I just print the email data instead)

```php
self.
  self.
    self.
      self.
        getSelfProp(%self%,translatedUserPostProps)@emails<
          forEach<

### Conclusion: That was a lot! What comes next?

I'm sure that if you have reached up to here, you must be tired! You certainly must not want to keep reading technical, boring code, even if were about the most shinily awesome API ever... right?

Me neither. So I will continue in another blog post to describe how this API either already deals with, or will soon, the following issues:

- HTTP Cache 
- Federation and Decentralization
- One-Graph solution for everything
- User permissions, Public/Private API
- Mutations

I hope you have enjoyed this. If so, please check out [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP) (where it explains how the component model works), and the myriad of repos implementing the logic:

- [GraphQL API](https://github.com/getpop/api-graphql)
- [API](https://github.com/getpop/api)
- [Engine](https://github.com/getpop/engine)
- [Component Model](https://github.com/getpop/component-model)
- [Field Query](https://github.com/getpop/field-query)
- [REST API](https://github.com/getpop/api-rest)
- [Posts](https://github.com/getpop/posts)
- [Translate Directive](https://github.com/getpop/translate-directive)
- [Google Translate Directive](https://github.com/getpop/google-translate-directive)

PoP has been implemented in PHP, it relies on Composer for installation, and it can work with most popular CMSs and frameworks (WordPress, Symfony, Laravel). It is still under heavy development, so I would advise against using it in PROD for the time being. But all code is stable, so please go ahead, download it, and play with it in your DEV environment. Fortunately, the data model in the PoP API is the existing one in the application (remember: There are no schemas!), so its introduction to an existing project can demand very low effort. 

The version for WordPress is ready to install. Simply add the following packages in your `composer.json` file:

```javascript
"require": {
  "getpop/engine-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/commentmeta-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/comments-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/pages-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/postmeta-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/posts-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/posts-api": "dev-master",
  "getpop/postmedia-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/taxonomies-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/taxonomymeta-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/taxonomyquery-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/usermeta-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/users-wp": "dev-master",
  "getpop/api-graphql": "dev-master",
  "getpop/api-rest": "dev-master",
  "getpop/google-translate-directive": "dev-master"
}
```

More detailed instructions for installation can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP-API-WP).
