Several months ago I started doing the migration of [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP)'s codebase to using Composer as its foundational framework for package management. In that moment, I decided to also decouple PoP's codebase from WordPress, making it CMS-agnostic. 

Oh boy, that was a lot of work! But sure it was all worth it! As a consequence, PoP can now run pretty much with any PHP-based framework, including [Symfony](https://symfony.com) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)! 

Yay!!!!!

If you are interested to know how the abstraction was accomplished, I have recently published an extensive account of it (split into 2 parts) for Smashing Magazine. Check it out here:

- Part 1: Abstracting WordPress code to reuse with other CMSs - Concepts
- Part 2: Abstracting WordPress code to reuse with other CMSs - Implementation

Enjoy!
