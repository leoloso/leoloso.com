With the publication last week of article [Adding Search To Your Site In 15 Minutes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/adding-search-website-sitesearch360/) on Smashing Magazine, I reached a personal milestone: it was my 100th (paid) article published on an online magazine!

(These are only the articles I've been paid for. I have also written [88 blog posts here on my own site](https://leoloso.com/posts), with some of them being just one liners and others full blown write-ups explaining something; and [17 posts on graphql-api.com](https://graphql-api.com/blog/), with some to promote the plugin and explain its features, and others to share discoveries that could be useful to other plugin developers and GraphQL users.)

Since [my first article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/service-worker-single-page-application-wordpress-sites/) was published on October 2017, it took a bit less than 5 years to reach this milestone, at an average of 1.8 articles per month, or one article published every 17 days.

Here are some lessons I learnt during my journey.

Can make an income from writing?
