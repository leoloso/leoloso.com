With the publication last week of article [Adding Search To Your Site In 15 Minutes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/adding-search-website-sitesearch360/) on Smashing Magazine, I reached a personal milestone: it was my 100th (paid) article published on an online magazine!

Since [my first article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/service-worker-single-page-application-wordpress-sites/) was published on October 2017, it took a bit less than 5 years to reach this milestone, at an average of one article published every 17 days.

This gives me a good reason to write again on my own blog (which I had been neglecting for a while). Here are some lessons I learnt during my journey.
