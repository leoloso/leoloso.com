The video for the [sneak preview](https://cmsphilly.org/talks/introduction-graphql-api-wordpress) to my upcoming GraphQL API for WordPress plugin (to be released this May!) has been published:

The quality of the video uploaded to YouTube is terrible though ðŸ˜¢, the videos are pretty much static. So in the upcoming days I'll link to each of the demoed videos, which I've uploaded to [this channel in Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/1576608). It will be 7 posts for 7 demoed functionalities:

â†’ Custom Endpoints<br/>
â†’ Persisted Queries<br/>
â†’ Access Control Lists<br/>
â†’ Public/Private Schema<br/>
â†’ HTTP Caching<br/>
â†’ Field Deprecation<br/>
â†’ API Hierarchy

Oh, btw, the plugin will ship with even more features! ðŸš€

The announcement has been made! The countdown to releasing the plugin has begun ðŸ˜Ž
