Yesterday I had a new article about WordPress Gutenberg published for the LogRocket blog: 

[Essentials for building your first Gutenberg block](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-first-gutenberg-block/)

This article gives a few tips for starting a new Gutenberg project, as I discovered them in my own journey. It's mainly useful for newbies, who either haven't started yet, or have recently begun and are navigating uncharted waters.

As always, I hope you enjoy it!
