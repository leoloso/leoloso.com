[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg) can help build better mobile apps (and other apps that need to consume data from our site), since it enables to cleanly identify and extract pieces of data (like images or videos) which can be referenced within the mobile app directly, instead of being lost within a soup of HTML. Combined with the [WP REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/), every single piece of metadata in our site then becomes available.

My plugin [Block Metadata](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-metadata/) makes it even easier, offering a process to easily expose our own metadata from our own blocks. The plugin's final goal is to make the content in our WordPress websites become the single source of truth of content for all our digital applications, following the [COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) strategy](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/10/create-once-publish-everywhere-wordpress/).

In my [latest article for Design Bombs](https://www.designbombs.com/exposing-wordpress-site-data-for-mobile-apps/) I describe how to export our site's data to power a mobile app. Enjoy!
