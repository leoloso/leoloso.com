I will describe why I have written the articles that I have written for [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com). This is not to ask you to follow my same motives, but just to demonstrate what has been my ongoing inspiration.

The topics for my articles, and the reasons why I wanted to publish them, can broadly be split into the following categories:

**1. Implementations of certain unique functionalities for my project "PoP"**, with two objectives: To share the train of thought that went into the design process and the decisions I took for the implementation, as a communication from developer to developer; and to promote [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP) along the way.

**2. Description of the concept on which PoP is based: building a website using components in the backend.** My objective is threefold: To describe this concept and all my knowledge about it with anyone who had never come across it; to promote PoP and, incidentally, get contributors to the project; and to associate my name with the concept, so that if it takes off, my personal working possibilities will be enhanced too.

**3. Conceptual and practical stuff.** The objective is simply to share my findings with the community, concerning whatever technology/project I happen to be working on.

**4. New stuff that I wanted to learn,** and which I documented along the way as I was learning it as to share my experience with the community.

I am now able to split my motivations into several categories, however this happens only in hindsight: At the moment of writing each article, I didn't have a master plan or an idea of what I would be writing next. Luckily, several ideas for new articles appeared naturally from the content of the piece I was writing at that moment. The result was a chain of write-ups, in which each piece became connected to the next one by some common topic:

1. During my [comparison of WordPress and October CMS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/wordpress-october-cms/), I discovered how October CMS is coded using modern PHP

2. I described [modern PHP in the context of WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/wordpress-modern-php/), and argued that WordPress would benefit from being integrated with Composer

3. I narrated how to [use Composer with WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/composer-wordpress/), mentioning that it makes sense to code in components and make themes and plugins simply be specific releases for WordPress

4. I explored [how to build CMS-agnostic components](...), demonstrating implementations for WordPress and October CMS
